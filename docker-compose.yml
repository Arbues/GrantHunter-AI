  # Playwright Service (Browserless-style or custom)
  # Using the official Playwright image and keeping it alive to accept commands via socket/API if needed,
  # or simply as a runner environment. For MCP, we might execute scripts INSIDE this container.
  # For simplicity in this MVP, we will use this container to run the 'Discovery MCP' code 
  # that needs browser access, or use it as a remote browser.
  # Strategy: We'll use a standard playwright image that stays running, 
  # and the Discovery MCP will connect to it or run inside it.
  # For better separation, let's use a 'browserless' style image which exposes a CDp endpoint.
